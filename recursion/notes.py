# Recursion 
# function calls itself directly or indirectly. 

# 1]Advantages of using recursion

# * A complicated function can be split down into smaller sub-problems utilizing recursion.
# * Sequence creation is simpler through recursion than utilizing any nested iteration.
# * Recursive functions render the code look simple and effective.


# 2}Disadvantages of using recursion


# * A lot of memory and time is taken through recursive calls which makes it expensive for use.
# * Recursive functions are challenging to debug.
# * The reasoning behind recursion can sometimes be tough to think through.


Syntax:

def func(): <--
              |
              | (recursive call)
              |
    func() ----
Example 1: A Fibonacci sequence is the integer sequence of 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8â€¦. 

Python3
# Program to print the fibonacci series upto n_terms
 
# Recursive function
def recursive_fibonacci(n):
  if n <= 1:
      return n
  else:
      return(recursive_fibonacci(n-1) + recursive_fibonacci(n-2))
 
n_terms = 10
 
# check if the number of terms is valid
if n_terms <= 0:
  print("Invalid input ! Please input a positive value")
else:
  print("Fibonacci series:")
for i in range(n_terms):
    print(recursive_fibonacci(i))
Output
Fibonacci series:
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
Example 2: The factorial of 6 is denoted as 6! = 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720. 

Python3
# Program to print factorial of a number
# recursively.
 
# Recursive function
def recursive_factorial(n):
  if n == 1:
      return n
  else:
      return n * recursive_factorial(n-1)
 
# user input
num = 6
 
# check if the input is valid or not
if num < 0:
  print("Invalid input ! Please enter a positive number.")
elif num == 0:
  print("Factorial of number 0 is 1")
else:
  print("Factorial of number", num, "=", recursive_factorial(num))
Output
Factorial of number 6 = 720
What is Tail-Recursion?
A unique type of recursion where the last procedure of a function is a recursive call. The recursion may be automated away by performing the request in the current stack frame and returning the output instead of generating a new stack frame. The tail-recursion may be optimized by the compiler which makes it better than non-tail recursive functions. 

Is it possible to optimize a program by making use of a tail-recursive function instead of non-tail recursive function? 
Considering the function given below in order to calculate the factorial of n, we can observe that the function looks like a tail-recursive at first but it is a non-tail-recursive function. If we observe closely, we can see that the value returned by Recur_facto(n-1) is used in Recur_facto(n), so the call to Recur_facto(n-1) is not the last thing done by Recur_facto(n). 

Python3
# Program to calculate factorial of a number
# using a Non-Tail-Recursive function.
 
# non-tail recursive function
def Recur_facto(n):
   
    if (n == 0):
        return 1
   
    return n * Recur_facto(n-1)
   
# print the result
print(Recur_facto(6))
Output
720
We can write the given function Recur_facto as a tail-recursive function. The idea is to use one more argument and in the second argument, we accommodate the value of the factorial. When n reaches 0, return the final value of the factorial of the desired number. 

Python3
# Program to calculate factorial of a number
# using a Tail-Recursive function.
 
# A tail recursive function
def Recur_facto(n, a = 1):
   
    if (n == 0):
        return a
   
    return Recur_facto(n - 1, n * a)
   
# print the result
print(Recur_facto(6))
Output
720
